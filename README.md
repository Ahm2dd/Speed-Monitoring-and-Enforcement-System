# Speed-Monitoring-and-Enforcement-System
The Speed Monitoring and Enforcement System is a project designed to improve road safety by detecting and managing speeding violations using advanced technologies like computer vision and real-time data processing


What is the Speed Monitoring and Enforcement System?
The system is a technology-based solution aimed at monitoring vehicle speeds, detecting violations, and enforcing speed limits. It typically uses cameras, sensors, and algorithms to track vehicle movement and identify vehicles that exceed the speed limit.

Key Features of Your Project:
-Vehicle Detection:
Real-time identification of vehicles using computer vision tools like OpenCV.

-Speed Calculation:
Calculates vehicle speeds between two points using video frames and timestamps.

-License Plate Recognition:
Uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools like Tesseract to read license plates automatically.

-Data Logging:
Stores information about speed violations, including timestamps and vehicle details, for further reporting and analysis.

-User Interface:
Provides a simple interface (possibly built with Flask) for accessing violation data and generating reports.

Purpose:
The goal of the system is to improve road safety by enforcing speed regulations effectively, reducing the chances of accidents caused by speeding.
